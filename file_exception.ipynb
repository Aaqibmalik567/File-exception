        "### **1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpreted languages** (like Python) execute code line-by-line using an interpreter at runtime. This allows for easier debugging and platform independence but may be slower.\n",
        "**Compiled languages** (like C or Java) require code to be translated into machine language by a compiler before execution. This generally results in faster performance but less flexibility during development.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception handling is a mechanism that allows developers to gracefully handle runtime errors and take appropriate actions without crashing the program. It uses blocks like `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` to detect and respond to different types of errors (e.g., `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `finally` block contains code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is often used for cleaning up resources like closing a file or releasing memory, ensuring that cleanup code runs no matter what happens in the `try` or `except` blocks.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **4. What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging is the process of recording messages or data during the execution of a program. Python’s `logging` module provides functions to log messages at different severity levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR). Logging is more flexible and robust than print statements and is commonly used in production code to trace issues or monitor application behavior.\n",

        "### **5. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `__del__` method is called when an object is about to be destroyed (usually when there are no more references to it). It's often used to free resources or perform cleanup tasks. However, it's not recommended for critical cleanup because the exact time of its call is unpredictable due to Python’s garbage collection.\n",

        "* `from module_name import function` imports only the specific function or class, allowing direct use without the module prefix.\n",

        "\n",
        "The `with` statement is used for resource management, especially file handling. It ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes execution, even if an error occurs.\n",

        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as f:  \n",
        "    data = f.read()\n",

        "### **9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Multithreading**: Multiple threads run within the same process. Useful for I/O-bound tasks, like reading files or web scraping.\n",
        "* **Multiprocessing**: Multiple processes run with separate memory. Ideal for CPU-bound tasks like computations.\n",
        "  Python has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), so multiprocessing often provides better performance in CPU-intensive tasks.\n",

        "* Allows logging at different severity levels\n",
        "* Supports writing logs to files, making debugging easier\n",

        "\n",
        "### **11. What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses **automatic memory management**, including reference counting and garbage collection. It keeps track of all references to an object and frees memory when the reference count reaches zero. The `gc` module helps in collecting objects involved in circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use a `try` block to enclose code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "2. Use `except` to catch and handle specific exceptions.\n",
        "3. Use `else` to run code if no exception occurs.\n",
        "4. Use `finally` for cleanup, regardless of what happened.\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "\n",

        "### **13. Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Proper memory management prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and avoids crashes. Since Python applications can grow large and dynamic, it's critical to ensure unused objects are released promptly.\n",

        "### **14. What is the role of `try` and `except` in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `try` identifies code that may raise an exception.\n",
        "* `except` catches and handles specific exceptions.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python primarily uses **reference counting**. Each object keeps count of references. When count reaches zero, it’s deleted.\n",
        "Python also has a cyclic garbage collector (`gc` module) that detects and collects objects involved in circular references which reference counting alone cannot handle.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **16. What is the purpose of the `else` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `else` block runs if no exception is raised in the `try` block. It’s useful to separate successful logic from exception handling, improving code clarity.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* `os.fork()` is a low-level system call available only on Unix/Linux; it duplicates the current process.\n",
        "* `multiprocessing` is a high-level, cross-platform Python module that allows you to spawn separate processes and avoid issues with the GIL.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "\n",
        "Closing a file:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Releases system resources\n",
        "* Ensures data is fully written (especially in write mode)\n",
        "* Prevents data corruption\n",

        "\n",
        "The `logging` module provides tools for tracking events during runtime. It allows messages to be recorded with time stamps, levels, and optional file output. It is more powerful and configurable than print statements.\n",
